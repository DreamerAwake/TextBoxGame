Scene001,Scene files used by this game are .csv files (essentially just spreadsheets) renamed to .scn for sorting purposes.,,enable_topics
Scene002,"Scene files have four columns, and each row contains either a stage direction or an event.",,enable_topics
Scene003,Stage directions always appear in the top rows of the file. The first column contains the name of the direction in ALL CAPS.,,enable_topics
Scene004,"The first stage direction is the /b <HEADER>. / The 2nd column of the header gives the text displayed at the top of the screen while the scene plays out, usually a title. The 3rd column gives the Event ID of the first event that this script will run.",,enable_topics
Scene005,"The second stage direction is /b <GENERIC_TOPICS>. / You will learn more about this direction in the section on topics. But simply put, the second column of this direction will usually have a list of topic names, like it does in this file.",,enable_topics
Scene006,The third is /b <STYLE>. / This one tells the game which color scheme you should use for this scene. Styles are defined in the styles.csv file.,,enable_topics
Scene007,"Each time you change to a scene with a different style, the screen will /i wipe / automatically.",,enable_topics
Scene008,"After all of the stage directions, events begin. The contents of an event's columns are as follows:",,silent

Choices001,"You just passed through a <Choice>. <Choices> let you control the flow of the game by letting the player respond, and well, make <choices>.",,mark reread enable_topics
Choices002,"<Choices> are given the /i choice / command, and are followed in the .scn file by several events with no <Event ID>s.",,enable_topics
Choices003,"The text of these Events becomes the wording used on their choice button, and their <Next ID> becomes the target event after they are picked.",,enable_topics

Choices005,"This event has /i return, / so it will take you back to the last mark. That mark also happens to have the /i reread / command, so when you get there, it will reread itself. Normally, after a /i return / the event would run without displaying its text.",return,enable_topics

Dialogue008,"""When you click on a <topic>, the game automatically sets a /i mark / so you can /i return / later on to the place where you were before you remarked on the <topic>. If you don't want this to happen, simply place a /i forget_mark / on the topic event.""",,[Tutorial] enable_topics
