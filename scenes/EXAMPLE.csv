Next003,"Choices are often used with marks and returns. If you leave a mark it will sit in a list; this list can be added to endlessly. The next return will bounce you to the last marked event and clear it. Keep in mind, that a marked event will mark itself again, pass it clear_marks or forget_mark to either clear all marks, or just the last mark, respectively.",,
Next004,"Marks without the reread Command will suppress reprinting their text when returned to. Reread commands like this one make chat clutter, but make it clearer where in the conversation flow the character is.",,choice mark reread
