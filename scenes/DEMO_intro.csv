HEADER,The Briny Sea - An Unfamiliar Island,Start001,
Start001,The dun beachhead before you glows palid under the pre-dawn unlight. The pungent <rotting sealife> along the shore mixes sourly with the sea spray that stings your face as the sailors around you put your little dinghy in against the roar of the blustering island wind. The <sailors> around you are deliberately avoiding your gaze as each bends his head to the work of the oars against the wine-dark waves.,,enable_topics
Start002,"The narrow beachhead rises about a yard above the waves before the stormswept sand comes to rest against a cliff of jagged stones. High above on a rocky precipice overlooking the sea is your destination. The Manor of <Doctor Lawrence Glubberwain>, your host for the coming days. It is an aweful looking place, at least from the outside; as jagged as the stones it’s perched upon and black as the inky water. ",,enable_topics
Start003,A light fills in the seaward window. There are shadows dancing past but they are indistinct. There may be people who have already arrived for the <party> inside.,,enable_topics
Start004,"The dinghy collides with the shore in a clatter of stones, and the Captain stands as soon as the shaking stops and leaps into the sea. He motions from the water for you to follow, then marches to shore.",,enable_topics
Start005,"You stand too, and disembark into knee-height seawater, cold as ice this morning.",,enable_topics
Start006,The Captain stands facing you as the wind whips the hair loose from his distinguished but sun-worn hat. It looks like he has something to say.,DEMO_captain,scene
Dr. Glubberwain,"Doctor Lawrence Glubberwain is a friend of your father’s. They taught together when you were very young. When he heard that you had returned to <On-Farness> he requested that you come to his birthday <party>, to be held on his private island in the West Sea.",return,disable_topics
party,"Dr. Glubberwain is set to turn ninety-four tomorrow. A mighty age for anything, and in absence of your father, he would at least like to see you again before he goes the way of most ninety-four year olds.",return,disable_topics
rotten sealife,"Not just fish, half-pecked and guts spilled by the incessant gulls, but other things too. A pearlescent mucous covers the largest boulders that litter the shoreline, shot with writhing veins that sink into the surf and are lost in the froth. There is something that might have been a dolphin, or maybe now part of a seal? It is rotting too, and is where you suspect at least 60% of the sourness arises. The thick strands of sunbaked and rehydrated kelp that mat the beach are no help on the smell front either.",return,disable_topics
sailors,"They are intensely set to their work, like men damned. You see their muscles bulge under sunburnt skin. They wear ratty linen tunics, sleeveless and cut down the side, and they grunt like argumentative pigs as they row. They sweat in the cold. ",,disable_topics
sailors002,"And, though you can feel their eyes on your back, when you look they are always bent down to the oars.",return,
